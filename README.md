# Web_Scrapping_Projects
These are my web scrapping Projects.
The First one called Jumia web scrapper does exactly that, it scrapes the Jumia website on the mobile phones category and stores information it retrieves in a csv file. I've included a csv file to share the info i retireved, The csv file is in this repo and I recommend that you have a quick look at it.
As you can see from the csv, the records are well stored as they were gotten from the jumia website. Theres a little mess but thats almost part of the cake in the data science world. :)
